# Google Homepage Project

This is a recreation of the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS. google-homepage

This was a great project to help me learn how to commit changes to git. I also had great fun trying to replicate the Google Homepage without using inspect to show me how it was done. 

It was quite tricky getting the main elements of the page positioned correctly but it has shown me that there are many ways to execute a project and I'm sure as I continue to learn I will find out better ways I could produced the same effects.

TO BE CONTINUED..
I still have quite a bit to do on this project and will update this README file as I continue.
